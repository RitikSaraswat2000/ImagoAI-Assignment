This script utilizes machine learning, specifically a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
and a Transformer, to predict vomitoxin levels in wheat using spectral data.

**Data Source:**
The script uses a dataset located at '/content/MLE-Assignment.csv'. This file
is assumed to contain spectral reflectance data for various wheat samples,
along with their corresponding vomitoxin levels (in ppb).

**Data Preprocessing:**
1. **Data Loading:** The data is loaded using pandas' `read_csv` function.
2. **Feature and Target Separation:** The dataset is divided into features (X)
   and the target variable (y), which represents vomitoxin levels.
3. **Missing Value Handling:** Missing values in the features are handled by
   imputation, using the mean value of each feature. This ensures the model
   can process all data points.
4. **Feature Scaling:** The features are normalized using `StandardScaler`
   from scikit-learn. This step is crucial for improving model performance,
   especially for algorithms sensitive to feature scales.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**
1. **Data Splitting:** The data is split into training and validation sets using
   `train_test_split` to assess the model's generalization ability.
2. **Model Selection:** This script explores two models:
   - **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP):** A feedforward neural network with
     multiple hidden layers. The architecture includes ReLU activation
     functions, batch normalization, and dropout for regularization.
   - **Transformer:** A model architecture based on the attention mechanism,
     commonly used in natural language processing but also showing promise
     in other domains.
3. **Model Training:** The selected model is trained using the training data.
   The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to
   minimize the mean squared error (MSE) loss function using the Adam
   optimizer.
4. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model's performance is evaluated on the
   validation set using various metrics:
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Measures the average squared difference
     between predicted and actual values.
   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** The square root of MSE, providing
     a more interpretable metric in the original units of the target variable.
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Measures the average absolute difference
     between predicted and actual values.
   - **R-squared (R2):** Represents the proportion of variance in the target
     variable explained by the model.

**Visualization:**
The script includes visualizations for model analysis:
1. **Actual vs. Predicted Values:** A scatter plot showing the relationship
   between the model's predictions and the actual vomitoxin levels. This
   helps visually assess the model's accuracy.
2. **Residuals vs. Predicted Values:** A scatter plot of residuals (the
   difference between actual and predicted values) against predicted values.
   This plot helps identify patterns in the errors and potential areas for
   model improvement.
3. **Distribution of Residuals:** A histogram displaying the distribution
   of residuals. This visualization helps check the assumption of normally
   distributed errors, which is often desirable for regression models.

**Results Analysis:**
- **Metrics:** The achieved values for MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared on the
  validation set provide quantitative measures of the model's performance.
  Lower values for MSE, RMSE, and MAE indicate better predictive accuracy,
  while a higher R-squared value suggests a better fit to the data.
- **Visualizations:** The plots aid in understanding the model's behavior.
  The actual vs. predicted plot reveals how well the model captures the
  overall trend. The residual plots help identify any systematic errors or
  heteroscedasticity (unequal variance of errors). The residual distribution
  plot provides insights into the normality of errors.

**Conclusion:**
By combining data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and
visualization, this script offers a comprehensive approach to predicting
vomitoxin levels in wheat using spectral data. The results, interpreted
through metrics and visualizations, provide valuable insights into the model's
performance and potential areas for refinement.
